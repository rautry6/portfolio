This plays into the arena's design of having the boss in the center and one-way platforms forming a semi circle above the boss and having enough of gap below the boss for the player to run through it. The coins also spawn in a clockwise pattern along the one ways when you pick them up further reinforcing this idea of following a circular pattern around the boss from the beginning of the fight.

There are large pillars of light that gradually become brigther the closer to the bottom the falling fireball is and there is an exclamation point to make sure the player knows to becareful so they do not initially mistake the glowing light as something positive and take unfair damage. The spawning of the pillars is based on the players movement, so the boss attempts to predict where they will a few seconds into the future based on the player's current x velocity.

The strut needed to be able to cut as well since it was a 4 x 20 piece of plywood. This formwork also added in a new way of building as the slab was built from the gound up while the wall had the player placing layers infront and behind each other which the build system was not built to handle well. We had to make a lot of changes to the build system to make it work with the wall formwork but it made the column formwork much easier to implement after.",

To fix this we decreased the snap distance so the player had to be more precise but it kept the pieces from snapping to the other points around where the player was trying to place them. We also added in a system where the player could rotate the piece they were placing to make it easier to place the pieces in the correct orientation. This also helped with the wall formwork as we simply could change the rotation axis to allow the pieces to be in the correct orientation. The final upgrade we did was to make the a free cam so the player could control exactly how they were looking at the formwork.",
